    Provide a filter for what points are shown:
        example filters include: videos, photos, text, etc.

    Should probably arrange them in a 10x2 grid (or something like that)
    This will be a side panel that appears when a parent annotation is selected


    Needs to export the chosen filters

    Will use checkboxes, the buttons will probably be icons of uniform size
    need to create/find icons, potentially need to have everyone vote on icons to use
