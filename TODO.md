- read the potree source code to get a better understanding of how it works/what it is doing
- build the ui using an iframe (temp) so the demo will be usable :C
- look at css/html formatting for the site itself
- go through potree and reassemble the viewer so it uses svelte instead of jquerry
- build the new site (svelte based) and add the additional functionality
